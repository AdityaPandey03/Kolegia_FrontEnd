## Development Setup

To set up Kolegia for development, you need to follow the steps mentioned below:

### Step 1: Install Node.js from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

During the developement process, I used node version `v16.13.0`. You can check your node version by running the following command:

```shell
node -v
```

### Step 2: Setup [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) environment.

Follow the steps mentioned in the official documentation to setup the environment.

### Step 3: Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/AdityaPandey03/Kolegia_FrontEnd.git

### Step 4: Install dependencies

    cd client

    npm install

### Step 5: Create a `.env` file for environment variables

You'll have to create a `.env` file for environment variables with the variables listed [here](https://github.com/kartikeyvaish/Kolegia_Mobile/blob/main/README.md#env-file)

### Step 6: Running the application

Run the app in the development mode.
Just type `npm start` in the terminal to open the website.
